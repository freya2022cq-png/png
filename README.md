I am writing to you regarding my manuscript titled "[Paper Title]" (ID: [Manuscript ID]), which was recently declined.

I fully respect the editorial decision. However, I would like to offer some clarifications regarding my background and the submission metadata, which I believe led to a significant misunderstanding. I sincerely apologize for a serious administrative oversight during the submission process that may have affected the evaluation of my manuscript.

1. Clarification of Author Background:
I would like to clarify my current academic status. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Chongqing University. Currently, I am a faculty member at Chongqing Polytechnic University of Electronic Technology, while simultaneously pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Chongqing University. This dual identity may have caused confusion regarding my affiliations.

2. Correction of Authorship (Crucial Oversight):
Due to a regrettable mistake during the file upload and metadata entry, I inadvertently failed to include my Ph.D. supervisor and a key contributing researcher in the author list. This was entirely my error in rushing the submission process.

I confirm that the work was conducted under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoping Zeng and with the assistance of Dr. Xin Xie. Both authors have reviewed the manuscript and approved its submission. The correct author list should include:

Missing Author (My Supervisor):

Name: Xiaoping Zeng

Affiliation: School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 401331, China

Email: zxp@cqu.edu.cn

Missing Author (3rd Author):

Name: Xin Xie

Affiliation: School of Automation, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing 400065, China

Email: xiexin@cqupt.edu.cn

3. Request for Opportunity to Resubmit:
We strongly believe that this research falls within the scope of Sensors and presents.

Could you please clarify if the rejection was due to specific technical deficiencies or the incomplete author metadata? If it is the latter, we kindly request an opportunity to correct the author list and resubmit the manuscript for your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding. I look forward to your guidance.

Sincerely,

Ya Wen
